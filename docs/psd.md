#10. PSD Files

We've shared all design psd files with this theme on dropbox.

You can download them from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ymuood8z1mb13tu/AADC9OJzrq5-YYSadvvM_SWOa?dl=0)

If you'd like to change the main image in the header, open "header.psd", make the necessary adjustments, and then save the file to jpg or png that will be used in the web page.
