#2. Generator

##2.1 Install Node.js
First, you must download and **install node.js** (which includes npm). **npm** stands for node packaged modules and is a way to manage development dependencies through [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). You can check it in your terminal window using these commands ```node --version``` and ```npm --version```. You can download [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) here.

##2.2 Prepare package
Run ```npm install``` on the root folder of Remark download package from command line.

##2.3 Use Generator
After npm installed, run ```npm run generate``` on the same folder of the remark download package from command line.

Note: if not working, you can try ```node .src/index.js``` command. If still not working, you can contact us for the issue.
